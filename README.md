World of Warcraft 3.3.5 addon for use with NPCBots that displays bot's equipped items in a window.

This addon works by scanning for items linked in chat by bots and parsing them into a new window.

As usual with addons, unpack in Interface/Addons

Usage: Login and ask a bot to show it's currently equipped items (Manage Equipment - Show me your inventory)
